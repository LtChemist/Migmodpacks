I am having the issue where the menu is pink and black checkers. When the game finally shows up, it is lagging so bad and has the FPS on the screen as 0-16 basically. It is lagging so bad, and this is a brand new gaming laptop that costs over $2,000. I can play other modpacks, but this modpack is messing up right now which is sad because my favorite world is on it that I spent over five hours making.
